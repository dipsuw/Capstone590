## Capstone590
Repository for the DATA 590 capstone project in the Masters of Science in Data Science program at the University of Washington, and prepared by Deepa Agrawal, Erin Orbits, and Angel Wang.  

### About the Project 
Seattle is one of the fastest growing big cities in the United States. While this prosperity provides economic opportunities for many residents, it also exacerbates urban inequity. Gentrification is one process that contributes to inequality. While the precise definition of gentrification differs among academic disciplines, in general, a gentrifying neighborhood is one that moves from the bottom half to the top half in the distribution of median household income, rent, or home prices.  
  
This project will produce a Gentrification Atlas, which allows stakeholders in the cityâ€™s development to identify the neighborhoods in danger of gentrification and visualize trends and impact of potential changes in Seattle. Three definitions of gentrification will be used; each rooted in theory from economics, sociology, and urban planning. The visualization tool can also be of use to policymakers, researchers, and citizens.  
  
The primary task for the project is the creation of a prediction model of gentrification, utilizing Census data from the past two decades, such as the median income of households in each neighborhood. The prediction model will identify those neighborhoods: that have gentrified, that are currently gentrifying, and that are in greatest danger of gentrifying.
